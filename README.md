# 🚀 BTP Legacy Integration Hub

**A complete SAP BTP integration solution** demonstrating clean-core data synchronization between legacy ECC systems and SAP HANA Cloud.

This project showcases a **production-ready integration pattern** using SAP Integration Suite, CAP services, and XSUAA security to extract, transform, and persist legacy data without system modifications.

---

## What This Solution Does

✅ **Legacy System Simulation** - CAP-based mock ECC system with realistic customer and order data  
✅ **Secure API Access** - OAuth2/XSUAA authentication protecting all endpoints  
✅ **Automated Data Sync** - Timer-based integration flow polling and transforming data  
✅ **Cloud Persistence** - Real-time data synchronization to HANA Cloud database  
✅ **Modern UI Experience** - Fiori Elements app for business users to view and manage data  
✅ **Production-Ready** - Deployable to Cloud Foundry with proper security configuration

## Architecture

```
Legacy ECC (CAP + XSUAA)  →  🔄 Integration Suite  →  ☁️ HANA Cloud
   OAuth2-secured APIs           Timer + Transform         Synchronized Data
                    ↓
             📱 Fiori Elements App
              Business User Interface
```

**Complete Data Flow:**
1. **CAP Service** exposes `/Customers` and `/Orders` as secured OData endpoints
2. **Integration Flow** polls APIs every minute, transforms JSON to SQL format
3. **HANA Cloud** stores synchronized data in `POLLING_DEMO` schema
4. **Fiori App** provides modern UI for business users to view and manage orders

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Legacy Simulation** | SAP CAP (Node.js) | OData services with sample business data |
| **API Security** | SAP XSUAA | OAuth2 authentication and role-based access |
| **Integration** | SAP Integration Suite | Timer-triggered iFlow with Groovy transformations |
| **Data Storage** | SAP HANA Cloud | Synchronized tables with timestamp tracking |
| **User Interface** | SAP Fiori Elements | List Report & Object Page for Orders management |
| **Deployment** | Cloud Foundry | MTA-based deployment with service bindings |

## Key Features

### **Enterprise Security**
- OAuth2 client credentials flow
- Role-based access control (Viewer/Admin roles)
- Tested authorization enforcement in Fiori UI:
  - Viewer: Read-only access, cannot edit Notes or other fields
  - Admin: Full edit capabilities including Notes field
- Role Collections assignment and testing completed
- Secure service-to-service communication

### **Intelligent Integration**
- Automated polling with configurable intervals
- Data transformation and enrichment via Groovy scripts

### **Real-time Synchronization**
- Timestamp-based change detection
- Incremental data updates
- JDBC-based persistence to HANA Cloud

### **Modern User Experience**
- Fiori Elements List Report and Object Page pattern
- Draft-enabled editing capabilities with custom fields (Notes column)
- Role-based UI access with tested authorization restrictions
- Viewer role: Read-only access (edit restrictions enforced)
- Admin role: Full CRUD operations including Notes field editing
- Role Collections properly configured and tested in BTP Cockpit
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Business Scenario

A manufacturing company needs to **synchronize data from their legacy SAP ECC system** to **SAP HANA Cloud** for reporting and analytics purposes.

The legacy system cannot be modified, so SAP BTP acts as the **integration bridge**, ensuring data consistency and providing secure access to synchronized data.

**This project demonstrates:**
- Non-invasive integration with legacy systems
- Secure data synchronization to cloud database
- OAuth2-secured APIs and data access
- Real-time data transformation and enrichment
